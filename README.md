# bible.com scraper

THIS ONLY WORKS WITH Python 3.9

Please refer to the original READ.md file here: https://github.com/mightmay/youversion-bible.com-downloader/blob/master/README.md

NOTE:
- I am using MacOS and Python 3.11.2. If you are using a different OS or Python version, please modify the code to fit your requirements.
- I am new to Python and Git, and I am still learning. If you have any suggestions or corrections, please let me know.
- An idea I could not implement was to create a script to automate the whole process from steps 5 to 7: receive variables (bible version ID, bible version abbreviation, output filename), run scrapy, run pip install xmltodict, and convert JSON file to XML. Maybe in future updates.

## Notes

- The downloaded json file will be in `\bible\data`
- JSON file structure (this is just an example, your .json file will not be in this order):

  ```json
  JList
  [
    {"BookName":
      {"ChapterNumber":
        {"VerseNumber":"Verse String"}

        ...
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
